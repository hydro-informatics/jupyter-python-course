    "*Python* provides two basic types of loops to iterate through objects or functions: the `for` and the `while` loop statements. Both loop types have additional options and can be combined with conditional statements. Conditional statements evaluate *boolean* arguments (`True`/`False`) using the keywords `if: ... else: ...`. This section introduces the two loop types and conditional statements as integral parts of loops.\n",

    "Conditional statements open with an `if` keyword, followed by a test condition (e.g., `variable >= 2`) and action to accomplish when the test condition is `True` ([*boolean*](pybase.html#boolean) test result). The conditional statement can be followed by the `elif` (*else if*) and/or `else` keywords, which represent alternative tests in the case that the `if` test-condition was `False`. However, when the `if` statement was `True`, none of the following statements will be evaluated."
