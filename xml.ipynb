    "This tutorial starts with some background information about XML and what XML has to do with workbooks and JSON: XML is the abbreviation of [*E**x**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage*](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/) that defines rules for encoding documents. XML was designed for straightforward usage over the internet and we encounter XML documents all the time, on websites (e.g., *XHTML*), in the shape office documents (e.g., Office Open XML such as *docx*, *pptx*, or *xlsx*), or podcasts (e.g., *RSS*). The strength of the XML format is its characteristic of being both machine-readable (i.e., a computer can process XML files) and human-readable (i.e., we can read it like a newspaper). In simple words, entering formulas in an xlsx workbook is simultaneously machine-readable and human-readable, since humans and computers can interpret and evaluate the formulas in this XML frame. Other file formats such as [*JSON* (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) resemble XML and this is why we look at how *Python* can extract information from and export information to both formats. In water resources engineering and research, we are mainly interested in the exchange of information with office workbooks (*xlsx* files), or with JSON files, which provide boundary conditions for numerical models.\n",

    "## Workbook (xlsx) Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we want to communicate with workbooks at all? We have already seen that *Python* is much more powerful than office programs for the systematic analysis of data sets. However, *Python* requires the abstraction of data fields in our minds to visualize for example the structure of a nested list. For this reason, data from and for marketing, your boss, or public authorities are often required to have visually easy-to-use workbook formats, which can be overlooked quickly. Still, we want to leverage the content of such workbook information efficiently with *Python* and we want to produce visually simplistic output that anyone can read without any *Python* knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen that *pandas* provides easy routines for importing and exporting data from and to workbooks, respectively (cf. {ref}`pd-files`) with *pandas*). *pandas* uses [*XlsxWriter*](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/) or [*openpyxl*](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) depending on what is available in the current *Python* environment. Both packages have different behaviors, in particular when it comes to writing new or in existing workbooks. This is why the most robust approach is the direct use of one particular workbook handling library, where *openpyxl* is one of the most powerful options (note: this assertion is subjective) and this section introduces workbook handling with *openpyxl*.\n",

Still, in order to avoid re-reading this lesson every time you want to manipulate a workbook, it is much more convenient to have your own workbook manipulation classes ready. For example, use custom `Read` and `Write` classes, where `Read` is the parent class of the `Write` class (see the section on [inheritance of classes](classes.html#inheritance)). The `Read` class may contain tailored functions for reading specific columns, rows, or arrays.

As water resources researchers and engineers, we produce geospatially explicit data of water depth and flow velocity with numerical models.

    "### Read (Decode) and Write (Encode) *JSON* Files with the `json` Library \n",
    "\n",
    "*JSON* files can be implemented in many programming languages including *HTML* and *Python*. This is also the reason why *Jupyter* notebooks (as used in this course) can be run in *Python* and displayed as a web page. *Python* has a built-in `json` library that enables *JSON* decoding and encoding. The `json` library provides a `json.dumps(DATA)` method to \"dump\" (i.e., encode) data in *JSON* format. Vice versa, the `json.load()` method reads data from *JSON* files. The following example illustrates encoding and decoding an arbitrary nested dataset with the `json` library."
