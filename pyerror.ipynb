    "The `print()` function is useful to print variables or computation progress to the console (not too often though - output takes time and slow calculations). For robust reporting of errors or other important messages, however, a log file represents a better choice. So what is a log file or the act of logging? We know logbooks from discoverers or adventurers, who write down their experiences ordered by dates. Similarly, a code can write down (*log*) its \"experiences\", but in a file instead of a book. For this purpose, *Python* provides the standard [*logging* library](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html). For the moment, it is sufficient to know that the *logging* library can be imported in any *Python* script with `import logging` (more information about packages, modules, and libraries is provided in the {ref}`sec-pypckg` section).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following script imports the *logging* module, and uses the following keyword arguments to set the `logging.basicConfig`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `filename=\"my-logfile.log\"` makes the logging module write to a file named `\"my-logfile.log\"` in the same directory where the *Pyhton* script is executed.\n",
    "* `format=\"%(asctime)s - %(message)s` sets the logging format to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.sss - `*Message text* (more format options are listed in the [*Python* docs](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#displaying-the-date-time-in-messages)).\n",
    "* `filemode=\"w\"` overwrites previous messages in the log file (remove this argument to append messages instead of overwriting).\n",
    "* `level=logging.DEBUG` defines the severity of messages written to the log file, where `DEBUG` is adequate for problem diagnoses in codes; other levels of event severity are:\n",
    "    - `logging.INFO` writes all confirmation messages of events that worked as expected.\n",
    "    - `logging.WARNING` (**default**) indicates when an unexpected event happened or when an event may cause an error in the future (e.g., because of insufficient disk space).\n",
    "    - `logging.ERROR` reports serious problems that caused that the code could not be executed.\n",
    "    - `logging.CRITICAL` is a broader serious problem indicator, where the program itself may not be able to continue running (e.g., *Python* crashes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Until here, messages are only written to the log file, but we cannot see any message in the console. To enable simultaneous logging to the log file and the console (*Python* terminal), use `logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())` (appends an *io* stream handler).\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a message to the log file (and *Python* terminal), use \n",
    "* `logging.debug(\"message\")` for code diagnoses,\n",
    "* `logging.info(\"message\")` for progress information (just like we used `print(\"message\")` before,\n",
    "* `logging.warning(\"warning-message\")` for unexpected event documentation (without the program being interrupted),\n",
    "* `logging.error(\"error-message\")` for errors that entail malfunction of the code, and\n",

    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "Document self-written error messages in except statements from the beginning on (e.g., in a markdown document) and establish a developer [wiki](../documentation/documentation) including possible error sources and remedy descriptions.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Descriptive Variable Names\n",
    "Give variables, functions and other objects descriptive and meaningful names. Abbreviations will always be necessary, but those should be descriptive. For variables and functions, use small letters only. For classes use CamelCase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deal with Errors\n",
    "If an error message is raised, read the error message thoroughly and several times to understand the origin of the error. Error messages often indicate the particular script and the line number where the error was raised. In the case that the error is not an apparent result misused data types or any of the above error messages (e.g., an error raised within an external module/package), use your favorite search engine to troubleshoot the error.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Code with a Structured Approach\n",
    "Think about the code structure before starting with punching in a bunch of code blocks and storing them in some *Python* files. Structural and/or behavior diagrams aid developing a sophisticated code framework. The developers of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) provide solid guidelines for developing structure and behavior [UML diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language#Diagrams) in software engineering.\n",

    "Explain your problem to a friend (or just speak out loud). Rephrasing and trying to explain a problem to another person (even if it is just an imaginery person or group of people) often represents the troubleshot itself.\n",
    "Take a walk, sleep on the problem or do other things with low brain occupation. While you are dealing with other things, your brain continues to think about the problem (wikipedia devoted a page to this so-called process of [*incubation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_(psychology)))."
