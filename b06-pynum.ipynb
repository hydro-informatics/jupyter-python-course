    "# Pandas \n",

    "*pandas* is a powerful module (package) for data analyses and manipulation with *Python*. It has can handle *NumPy* arrays, and both packages jointly represent a powerful data processing engine. The power of *pandas* lies in processing data frames, data labeling (e.g., workbook-like columns names), and flexible file handling functions (e.g., the built-in `read_csv(csv-file)`). While *NumPy* arrays enable calculations with multidimensional arrays (beyond 2-dimensional tables) and low memory consumption, *pandas* `DataFrame`s efficiently process and label tabular data with more than ~100,000 rows. Because of its labelling capacity, *pandas* also finds broad application in machine learning. In summary, *pandas*' functionality builds on top of *NumPy* and both packages are developed by the [*SciPy*](https://www.scipy.org/) (*Scientific computing tools for Python*) community that also develops `matplotlib` (see [the plotting section](https://hydro-informatics.com/python-basics/pyplot) and *IPython* (*Jupyter*'s *Python* kernel)."

    " The major difference between a *NumPy* `array` and a *pandas* `DataFrame` is that *NumPy* array only have one single data type (`dtype`), while a *pandas* `DataFrame` can have differents data types (one `dtype` per column). This is why a *NumPy* `array` can be seamlessly converted to a *pandas* `DataFrame`, but the opposite conversion can cause high computational cost. *pandas* comes with a built-in function to convert a *pandas* `DataFrame` into a *NumPy* `array`, where numeric variables are maintained where possible. If one column of the *pandas* `DataFrame` is non-numeric, the conversion involves copying the object, which then causes high computational cost. Note that *pandas* `DataFrame` *index* and *column* labels are lost in the conversion."
