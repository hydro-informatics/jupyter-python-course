The function blocks feature the conversion of a *numpy* array into a GeoTIFF raster according to the following workflow:\n",

    "1. Instantiate a `band` object, set the `NoDataValue` to `nan_value`, and write the array to the `band`.\n",

In the case of `epsg=3857`, the unit is `meters` and `pixel_width=10` combined with `pixel_height=20` creates 10-m wide and 20-m high pixels. In the case of `epsg=4326`, the unit is (geographic) `degrees` and 1 degree by 1-degree pixels can have the size of a count(r)y."

    "\n",
    "In hydraulic and geospatial analyses, the question of statistical values of certain areas of one or more rasters often arises. For instance, we may be interested in mean values and standard deviations in specific zones of a water body. For this purpose, *Zonal statistics* enable the delineation of an area of a raster by using a polygon shapefile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *River Architect* dataset includes a slackwater zone and zonal statistics help to identify the mean water depth and flow velocity of slackwaters, which are a so-called morphological unit ([recall the create-shapefile section](https://hydro-informatics.com/jupyter/geo-shp.html#create-shp)).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Background:** Instream morphological units aid to describe the geospatial organization of fluvial landforms, which play an important role in ecohydraulic analyses and river restoration. For instance, *pool* units describe deep water zones with low flow velocity, *riffle* units are typically characterized by shallow water depths and high velocity, and *slackwater* units are shallow flow zones with low flow velocity (many juvenile fish love slackwaters). [Wyrick and Pasternack (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X14000099) introduce the delineation of morphological units and an open-access summary can be found in the [Appendix Sect. 5 in Schwindt et al.

The following figures guide through the creation of a polygon shapefile and the delineation of the riffle with QGIS. Start with opening QGIS and create a new project.

Let's take for a moment the position of a fish that, after a flood with decreasing discharge, wants to swim as fast as possible from the floodplain back into the main channel where there is enough water. In the figure below, point 1 shows the starting point on the floodplain and point 2 the destination in the main channel.

The reason for this is that many hydroelectric power plants cause abrupt fluctuations in discharge due to fluctuations in energy demand and production (so-called **hydro-peaking**). As a result, there is a high stranding risk for fish in many regulated rivers that are subjected to hydro-peaking. The following figure illustrates stranding risk zones as a function of discharge (in cubic feet per second) at the lower Yuba River (California, USA).\n",
