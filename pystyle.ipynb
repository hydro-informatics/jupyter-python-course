The full document is available at [python.org](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and only aspects with relevance for the applications shown at *hydro-informatics.github.io* are featured on this page.\n",

    "**So what is *PEP*?** *PEP* stands for ***P**ython **E**nhancement **P**roposals*, in which *Python* developers communicate features and developments of *Python*. At the time of writing these lines, there are twelve (minus two) *PEP*s dedicated to the development of *Python* modules, bug fix releases, and also style guides (read the full and current list of *PEP*s at [python.org](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/#id6)). Here, we will use recommendations of *PEP* 8, the style guide for *Python* code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many *IDE*s, including *PyCharm* provide auto-completion and tool tips with *PEP* style guidance to aid consistent programming. So if *PyCharm* underlines anything in your script, check the reason for that and consider to modify the code accordingly."
