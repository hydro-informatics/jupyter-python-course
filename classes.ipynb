    "*Python* is an inherently object-oriented language and makes the deployment of classes and objects extremely easy. Let's start with essential definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that aligns the architecture of software with reality. Object orientation starts with the design of software, where a structured model is established. The structured model contains information about objects and their abstractions. The development and implementation of object-oriented software requires a structured way of thinking and the conceptual understanding of classes, inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects and Classes\n",
    "In computer language, an **object** is an instance that contains data in the shape of fields (called *attributes* or *properties*) and code in the shape of features (*functions* or *methods*). The features of an object enable access (read) and manipulation of its data fields. Objects have a concept of `self` regarding their attributes, methods and data fields. `self` internally references attributes, properties or methods belonging to an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *Python*, an object is an instance of a class. Thus, a **class** represents a blueprint for many similar objects with the same attributes and methods. A class does not use system memory and only its instance (i.e., objects) will use memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sschwindt/hydroinformatics/main/docs/img/classes_objects.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of a class in *Python* only includes some statements, and it is highly recommended to add an `__init__` statement where class variables are defined. We will come back to the `__init__` statement later in the section on *magic* methods. The following example shows one of the simplest classes with an `__init__` method. Note the usage of `self` in the class, which becomes `object_name.attribute` for instances of the class."

Similarly, inheritance in OOP describes the hierarchical relationship between classes with *is-a-type-of* relationships. For example, a class `Salmon` may inherit from a class `Fish`. In this case, `Fish` is the parent class (or super-class) and `Salmon` is the child class (or sub-class), where `Fish` might define attributes like `preferred_flow_depth` or `preferred_flow_velocity` and fuzzification methods to describe other habitat preferences.

    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "In computer science, polymorphism refers to the ability of presenting the same programming interface for different basic structures. Admittedly, a definition cannot be much more abstract. So it is sufficient to focus here only on the meaning of polymorphism relevant in *Python* and that is when child classes have methods of the same name as the parent class. For example, polymorphism in *Python* is when we re-define the `swim_to_position` function of the above show `Fish` parent class in the `Salmon` child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation (Public and Non-public Attributes)\n",
    "The concept of encapsulation combines data and functions to manipulate data, whereby both (data and functions) are protected against external interference and manipulation. Encapsulation is also the baseline of [data hiding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding) in computer science, which segregates design decisions in software regarding objects that are likely to change. Here, the most important aspect of encapsulation is the differentiation between `private` and `public` class variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "`private` attributes cannot be modified from outside (i.e., they are protected and cannot be changed for an instance of a class). In *Python*, there are no inherently `private` variables and this is why *Python* docs talk about `non-public` attributes (i.e., `_single_leading_underscore` *def*s in a class) rather than `private` attributes. While using a single underscore is rather good practice without technical support, we can use `__double_leading_underscore` attributes to emulate private behavior with a mechanism called *name mangling*. Read more about variable definition styles in the [style guide](pystyle.html#object-styles).\n",
    "\n",
    "`public` attributes can be modified externally (i.e., different values can be assigned to `public` attributes of different instances of a class).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example of the `Salmon` class, we use a public variable `self.family`. However, the family attribute of the `Salmon` class is an attribute that should not be modifiable. A similar behavior would be desirable for an `self.aggregate_state = 'frozen'` of the `IceCream` class. So let's define another child of the `Fish` class with a non-public `__family` attribute. The `__family` attribute is not directly accessible for instances of the new child class `Carp`. Still, we want the `Carp` class to have a `family` attribute and we want to be able to print its value. This is why we need a special method `def family(self)`, which has an `@property` decorator (recall [decorators on the functions page](pyfun.html#wrappers)). The below example features another special method `def family(self, value)` that is embraced with a `@property.setter` decorator that enables re-defining the non-public `__family` property (even though this is logically nonsense here because we do not want to enable renaming the `__family` property).\n"

Because of their declaration using double underscores (`__this_is_magic__`), magic methods are also called *dunder* (**d**ouble **under**score) methods. Magic methods are special methods with fixed names and their *magic* name is because they do not need to be directly invoked. Behind the scenes, *Python* constantly uses *magic* methods, for example when a new instance of a class is assigned: When you write `var = MyClass()`, *Python* automatically calls `MyClass`'es `__init__()` and `__new__()` *magic* methods. Magic methods also apply to any operator or (augmented) assignment. For example, the `+` binary operator makes *Python* look for the magic method `__add__`. Thus, when we type `a + b`, and both variables are instances of `MyClass`, *Python* will look for the `__add__` method of `MyClass` in order to apply `a.__add__(b)`.

    "This section features a couple of examples with options for implementing public and non-public properties and customizations of *magic* methods to enable the use of operators such as `+` or `<=` with custom classes. So there are many options in writing custom classes and all custom classes should at least incorporate the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__init__(self, [...)` is the class initializer, which is called when an instance of the class is created. More precisely, it is called along with the `__new__(cls, [...)` method, which is rarely used (read more at [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=__new__%20method#object.__new__)). The initializer gets the arguments passed with which the object was called. For example when `var = MyClass(1, 'vanilla' )`, the `__init__(self, [...)` method gets `1` and `'vanilla'`.\n",
    "* `__call__(self, [...)` enables to call a class instance directly, for example `var('cherry')` (corresponds to `var.__call__('cherry')`) may be used to change from `'vanilla'` to `'cherry'`.\n",
