    "# Code Style and Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Make your code consistent through style conventions: Take a deep breath, take off and look at what you have learned so far from a new perspective. After this chapter, it will be worth having another look at your old code and formatting it robustly. The style guidelines presented here go beyond visual aesthetics and aid in writing effective code.\n",

    "\n",
    "This style guide highlights parts of the [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. The full document is available at [python.org](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and only aspects with relevance for the applications shown in this eBook are featured in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is *PEP*?** *PEP* stands for ***P**ython **E**nhancement **P**roposals*, in which Python developers communicate features and developments of Python. At the time of writing these lines, there are twelve (minus two) *PEP*s dedicated to the development of Python modules, bug fix releases, and style guides (read the full and current list of *PEP*s at [python.org](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/#id6)). This section features recommendations of *PEP* 8, the style guide for Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many IDEs, including PyCharm or Atom, provide auto-completion and tooltips with *PEP* style guidance to aid consistent programming. Thus, when your IDE underlines anything in your script, check the reason for that and consider modifying the code accordingly."

In a broader sense, indentations represent namespaces, where *local* variables defined in the indented region are valid only here. Multiple levels of indentation occur when nested statements are used (e.g., an `if` condition nested in a `for` loop). One level of indentation corresponds to 4 spaces."
