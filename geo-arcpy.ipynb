    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "*ESRI*'s *ArcGIS Pro* software comes with its own *conda* environment that enables working with the commercial `arcpy` library. `arcpy` is accessible either directly in `ArcGIS Pro` or by using *ESRI*'s *conda* environment, which can be managed through *ArcGIS Pro*. Since `arcpy` is tied to the use of a commercial environment, it can only be accessed in *jupyter* notebooks directly hosted at [esri.com](https://notebooks.esri.com/) (however, these will not work with the examples on this page). This page explains the basic usage of `arcpy` in external [*IDE*](../get-started/ide.html#ide)s (e.g. *PyCharm*), the integration of licenses, and basic functionality of `arcpy`.\n",

    "\n",
    "***Why can working with `arcpy` in *Python* still be a powerful tool even though there are many license and platform restrictions?***\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are working for a company with engineering service, it is likely that the company uses the *ArcGIS* software because of its popularity and commercial support service. In this case a company (or research institution) covers the license fees and it is equally likely that a *Windows* operating system is used for similar reasons. Among the popular functionalities of *ArcGIS* software are *Raster Calculator*, *Shapefile Feature* manager or tools for statistical analysis of geo-databases. Thanks to `arcpy`, such popular *ArcGIS* tools can be embedded in *Python* scripts, thus enabling workflows to be automated and efficiency to be significantly increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "This page shows the basics for manipulating raster and shapefile data in *Python* with `arcpy`. There are many more methods implemented in `arcpy` and only the fundamentals are explained here.\n",

    "The *Python* installation section explains [how to set up *PyCharm IDE*](](../python-basics/pyinstall.html#ide-setup) with a *conda* environment. To create a new *conda* environment in *PyCharm* with *ESRI*'s *conda* environment, the ***Location*** must be defined differently (see the [original screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sschwindt/hydroinformatics/main/docs/img/pyc-prj-setup.png)):\n",

    "\n",
    "It may occur that it is not necessary to add the `propy` directory. Moreover, find the `conda.exe` or `python.exe` in the above directories and define it in the field ***Conda executable***. Finalize the creation of the new environment with a click on *Create*.\n",

    "The geospatial [shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) vector format is an *Esri* invention. No wonder that `arcpy` is good at handling this vector data format. In hydraulic engineering, however, we usually create (draw) shapefiles manually either directly with *ArcGIS* or its open-source competitor [*QGIS*](https://www.qgis.org/) to delineate, for example, particular flow regions. Examples can be found [in the BASEMENT tutorial](../numerics/basement) simulation (explore the creation of elevation point, boundary polygon, and breakline polyline shapefiles). In codes, the processing of shapefiles only becomes important in the analysis of the output of numerical models (e.g., to classify morphological unit features, exactly calculate patch areas, or automatically place reinforcements in construction plans). At this stage, raster data (output of numerical models) must first be converted into shapefiles. This is why this tutorial starts with the conversion of raster data to shapefiles along with the illustration of other functions such as calculating patch area and accessing shapefile attribute tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rasters can be converted to polygon and other shapefile types (e.g., point). The following example features the conversion of a raster to a polygon shapefile. It uses an integer raster of all pixels where the flow depth and velocity are smaller than 1.4 m and 0.15 m/s, respectively. Such shallow and slow-flow regions are called *slackwater* (according to [Wyrick & Pasternack 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.12.040)). Because slackwater is designated preferred habitat of some aquatic species, we are wondering now how much slackwater area the numerical model predicts in the simulated river section.
