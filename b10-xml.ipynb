    "# Structured Data (XML, xlsx & JSON)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create, manipulate and copy semi-structured data files in the form of xlsx-workbooks and JSON files: This chapter starts with background information about XML and what XML has to do with workbooks, and JSON: XML is the abbreviation of [*E**x**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage*](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/) that defines rules for encoding documents. XML was designed for straightforward usage over the internet and we encounter XML documents all the time, on websites (e.g., *XHTML*), in the shape office documents (e.g., Office Open XML such as *docx*, *pptx*, or *xlsx*), or podcasts (e.g., *RSS*). The strength of the XML format is its characteristic of being both machine-readable (i.e., a computer can process XML files) and human-readable (i.e., we can read it like a newspaper). For instance, entering formulas in an xlsx workbook is simultaneously machine-readable and human-readable, since humans and computers can interpret and evaluate the formulas in this XML frame. Other file formats such as [*JSON* (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) resemble XML and Python can extract information from and export information to both formats. In water resources engineering and research, for example, we are mainly interested in the exchange of information with office workbooks (*xlsx* files), or with JSON files, which provide boundary conditions for numerical models.\n",

    "## Workbook (xlsx) Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we want to communicate with workbooks at all? We have already seen that Python is much more powerful than office programs for the systematic analysis of data. However, Python requires the abstraction of data in our minds to visualize, for example, the structure of a nested list. For this reason, data from and for marketing, your boss, or public authorities are often required to have visually easy-to-use workbook formats, which can be overlooked quickly. Still, we want to leverage the content of such workbook information efficiently with Python and we want to produce visually simplistic output that anyone can read without any Python knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen that *pandas* provides easy routines for importing and exporting data from and to workbooks, respectively (cf. [file reading and writing with pandas](https://hydro-informatics.com/jupyter/pynum.html#pd-files)) with *pandas*). *pandas* primarily uses [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) depending on what is available in the active Python environment. *openpyxl* is one of the most powerful options for handling workbooks with Python (note: this assertion is subjective) and this section introduces *openpyxl*.\n",

    "* **workbook** is the main *xlsx* file we work with (also called *spreadsheet*);\n",
    "* **sheet** is tabular content of a workbook and one workbook can have multiple sheets;\n",
